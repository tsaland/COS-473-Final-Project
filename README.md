# On-Chain DeFi Analytics
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of an on-chain analytics app. The idea revolves around the fact that, due to the public nature of blockchains, one would be able to track the movement of insiders, the whales, with exact accuracy.

Special thanks to Professor Pramod Viswanath, Viraj Nadkarni, and Ranvir Rana for their guidance in this project.
