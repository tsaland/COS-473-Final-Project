# WhaleWatch
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of WhaleWatch, a deep-learning trading bot on Ethereum. The bot is designed to automatically collect on-chain market signals from whales, forecast daily ETH prices with an LSTM model, and execute trades on Uniswap. Whales movements are a unique indicator in the crypto market since it is not possible to identify, let alone track, users in TradFi. We aim to quantify the prediction power of whale movements and produce systematic trading strategies accordingly. 

Example code for data collection can be found in 

We are currently in the middle of fine-tuning risk parameters for better performance on live data.
